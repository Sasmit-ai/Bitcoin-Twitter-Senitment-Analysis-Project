# Bitcoin Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project
This data analytics project is motivated by my interest in the development of the cryptocurrency market. This was a fun approach to see if I could predict cryptocurrencies by basic technical analysis and sentiment analysis. Based on the premise that social media plays a role in price movements for specific financial instruments evidently  by when Elon Musk inflated the price of Dogecoin through a string of tweets and the pump of GameStop by r/wallstreebets. Using a dataset of tweets with sentiment analytics techniques to develop features to implement into a LSTM neural network model to predict bitcoin pricing over the years. Along with technical analysis techniques such as SMA and RSI I was able to predict bitcoin pricing with a margin of error of about 0.8%
